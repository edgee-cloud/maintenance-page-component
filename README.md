This component provides a simple maintenance page on [Edgee](https://www.edgee.cloud),
served directly at the edge. It's meant to be mapped to the root of your website, but you can
also map it to specific sub-paths.


## Quick Start

1. Download the latest component version from our [releases page](../../releases)
2. Place the `maintenance.wasm` file in your server (e.g., `/var/edgee/components`)
3. Add the following configuration to your `edgee.toml`:

```toml
[[components.edge_functions]]
id = "maintenance"
file = "/var/edgee/components/maintenance.wasm"
settings.edgee_path = "/path" # exact match
settings.edgee_path_prefix = "/prefix" # will match /prefix/anything
```
Note that either `edgee_path` or `edgee_path_prefix` must be set, but not both.
